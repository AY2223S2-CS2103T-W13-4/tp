## Commands


:information_source: **How to interpret the Command format:**<br>

* The terms in `UPPER_CASE` are placeholders need to replace with your n values. For example, in the command `new-student name/NAME`, `NAME` is a placeholder that can be substituted with a specific name, such as `new-student n/John Doe`.
