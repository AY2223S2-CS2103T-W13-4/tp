TutorPro is a **desktop app designed to help private tutors manage their student information effectively**. With TutorPro, tutors can easily keep track of their students' addresses, contact details, lessons, homework, and progress, all in one place. This app is optimized for use via a Graphical User Interface (GUI), allowing tutors to interact with the app using easy-to-understand buttons and menus. However, TutorPro also provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) for those who prefer a faster way of getting things done. Whether you're managing a handful of students or hundreds, TutorPro can help you streamline your workflow and make your tutoring experience more efficient.

## GUI
When you first run the app, you may see a display window pop up similar to the one below. We call this window the **Main Window**. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The current version of the window is not resizable. Resizability will be added in future versions!
</div>

![Starting Display Window](images/GUI.jpg)

* The **Command Box** on the left bottom refers to the text field where you can type in all your commands.
* The **Display List for Students** on the left top refers to the section where all the students are displayed.
* The **Detailed Information Section** on the right refers to the section where more specific information of the profile, homework, lessons, or exams of a particular student is displayed.

You may enter the following commands in the Command Box to see how the Display List changes:
* `list` lists all students.
* `delete 1` deletes the student with index 1.
* `view-homework` displays all the homework from all students.

You may also click the quick access buttons one each student card to see how the Detailed Information Section changes.
      
### Quick Access Buttons and Detailed Information Section
Upon launching the application or executing a command, a welcome page will be displayed in the Detailed Information Section. 
Each Student card has four buttons, which are profile, homework, lessons, and exams. When a user clicks on any of the buttons, the corresponding information will be presented in the Detailed Information Section.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Why is the date and time displayed in two different formats?**<br>
The date and time format in the Detailed Information Section is different from the one used in the `view` commands.
This is purposely done to make the information more distinct and make sure you never get confused.
</div>

#### Profile Page
Upon clicking the Profile Button, the Detailed Information section will be refreshed and show the detailed particulars of the student, including the student's full name, phone number, address, and email.

![Starting Display Window](images/Profile.jpg)

#### Homework Page

Upon clicking the Profile Button, the Detailed Information section will be refreshed and show the detailed homework information of the student. 

It includes a homework list, showing all the homework information.
The icon on the left of each homework represents its status,
with the tick icon being `completed` and the cross-icon being `pending`.
It also has a pie chart which represents a ratio between completed and pending homework.

![Starting Display Window](images/Homework.jpg)

#### Lessons Page

Upon clicking the Lesson Button,
the Detailed Information section will be refreshed and show the detailed Lessons Information for the student.

It includes a past lessons list, showing all the past lesson information and an upcoming lessons list,
showing all the upcoming lessons.

![Starting Display Window](images/Lessons.jpg)

:bulb: **Tip:** Lesson Lists do not have indexes to avoid confusion with the indexes of the lessons in the original list.
If you want to see the index of the lessons in the list,
you can use the `view-lessons` command to view the list of lessons.

:bulb: **Tip:** This page only shows the most basic information of the lessons. If you want to see more details of the lessons, you can use the `view-lessons` command to view the list of lessons.

#### Exams Page

Upon clicking the Exam Button,
the Detailed Information section will be refreshed and show the detailed Exams Information for the student.

It includes a past exams list, showing all the past exams information and all the upcoming exams list,
showing all the upcoming exams. 

![Starting Display Window](images/Exams.jpg)

:bulb: **Tip:** Exam Lists do not have indexes to avoid confusion with the indexes of the exams in the original list.
If you want to see the index of the exams in the list,
you can use the `view-exams` command to view the list of exams.

:bulb: **Tip:** This page only shows the most basic information of the exams. If you want to see more details of the exams, you can use the `view-exams` command to view the list of exams.

## Main Entities
TutorPro allows you to easily handle three main entities of your students: `Homework`, `Lesson`, and `Exam`.
TutorPro also has unique mechanisms to handle duplicate entities and potential clashes between entities.
Please refer to the [#Duplicate Detection Mechanism](#duplicate-detection-mechanism) and [#Schedule Clash Detection Mechanism](#schedule-clash-detection-mechanism) sections for more details.

### Homework
A `Homework` is an assignment that you've assigned to a `Student`.
It has a description, a deadline, and a status.
The status can be either `pending` or `completed`.

### Lesson
A `Lesson` is a scheduled meeting between you and a `Student`.
It has a name, a start time, an end time, and a status.
The status can be either `done` or `not done`.

### Exam
An `Exam` is a scheduled exam that a `Student` is going to sit for.
We assume that the exams are conducted by the school, instead of you.
It has a name, a start time, an end time, and a status, an optional weightage, and an optional grade.
The status can be either `done` or `not done`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:**<br> The status used for `Lesson` and `Exam` is different from the status used for `Homework`.<br>
This is because the status of `Homework` is determined by the user, (using mark as done or unmark commands) while the status of `Lesson` and `Exam` is determined by the time.
Therefore, we use different terms to avoid confusion.
</div>

## Commands

### How to interpret the Command format

* The terms in `UPPER_CASE` are placeholders need to replace with your n values. For example, in the command `new-student name/NAME`, `NAME` is a placeholder that can be substituted with a specific name, such as `new-student n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[name/STUDENT_NAME]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `name/John Doe`, `name/John Doe name/Jane Doe` etc.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that don't take in parameters
  (such as `help`, `exit,` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
* Unless otherwise specified, the order of prefixes doesn't matter.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `name/NAME phone/PHONE_NUMBER`, `phone/PHONE_NUMBER name/NAME` is also acceptable unless stated otherwise in a particular command.
* Parameters can be in any order.
* TutorPro allows you to execute commands on students in the entire student list, instead of just the displayed list. 
  For example: 
  - currently, the displaying list only shows one student, `Bernice Yu`.
    
    ![Entire List](images/entireList1.jpg)
  - However, you can still execute commands to `John Doe` even though he is not displayed in the list.
    
    ![Entire List](images/entireList2.jpg)
  - This is because `John Doe` is in the original student list, and the command will be executed on the original student list.
      
  - ![Entire List](images/entireList3.jpg)


### Profile Commands

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Why TutorPro uses search by index for all the Profile Commands instead of the unique search by name mechanism?**<br>
For profile commands, especially `delete` and `update-info` command, that may potentially change the name of the student, TutorPro uses search by index instead of search by name to avoid any confusion that may be caused by the name change. 
</div>

#### Create a new Student Profile

Format: `new-student [name/STUDENT_NAME] [address/STUDENT_ADDRESS] [phone/PHONE] [email/EMAIL] [school/SCHOOL] [level/GRADE_LEVEL]`

* SCHOOL and GRADE_LEVEL consist of numbers and letters only (no symbols or spaces).

Example:

* `update-info index/3 name/John` Changes the name of the student at index 3 to `John`.

* `field/NEW_INFO` is to be replaced by one of
  * `name/`
  * `phone/` 
  * `address/`
  * `school/` 
  * `level/`<br>
  And their respective new values.
* At least one updated parameter has to be present.<br>

![Update Info](images/update-info.png)

  :bulb: **Tip:** You can edit multiple fields in a student's profile at once by using several of the above prefixes.

Examples:
* `update-info index/1 name/John` Changes the name of the student at index 1 to `John`.
* `update-info index/2 name/John address/Block 414` Changes the name and address of a student at index 2 to `John` and `Block 414` respectively.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** Why do TutorPro allows adding homework and exams to multiple students in one command, but only allows adding lessons to one student at a time?<br>
This is because TutorPro assume all lessons you have with a student are one-to-one. Therefore, it is not possible for you to plan a single lesson with multiple students at the same time.
However, on the other hand, it is perfectly possible for you to assign the same homework to multiple students at the same time. It is also possible for multiple student to attend to the same exam at the same time.

  one student. eg. `delete-exam name/John name/Faye index/1` will attempt to match each name to a student being tracked,
 and will result in exams of index '1' of students 'John' and 'Faye' being removed from TutorPro.

Examples:
* `delete-exam name/John Doe index/1`
* `delete-exam name/John Doe name/Faye Doe index/1` -this command will remove both students John's and Faye's 1st 
indexed exam, and will behave similarly to `delete-exam name/John Doe index/1` and `delete-exam name/Faye Doe index/1`
being run one after another.

## Unique Mechanisms

### Search by Name Mechanism

* TutorPro uses Students' Names as primary keys to identify students.
* Most of the commands (except) in TutorPro allow you to search for a student by name, rather than by index, which is more intuitive for the user and eliminates the need to remember the index of the student.
* Therefore, duplicate names aren't allowed. Names that are substrings of other names or vice versa aren't allowed. For example, `John Doe` and `John` are not allowed. If you have students with the exact name, say `John Doe`, you can add a number to the end of the name to differentiate them. For example, `John Doe 1` and `John Doe 2`.
* The search by name mechanism is case-insensitive, meaning that the search will be case-insensitive. For Example, `john doe` and `John Doe` will be treated as the same name.
* Partial names can be used as well. For example, `doe` will return all students with the name `John Doe` and `Jane Doe`.

### Schedule Clash Detection Mechanism

#### Schedule Clash Detection Mechanism when Adding a New Lesson

##### With respect to existing lessons
* TutorPro will detect if there is a clash between the new lesson and existing lessons of all students. 
* Since TutorPro is meant for one tutor, it is assumed that the tutor will not be teaching two lessons at the same time.
* When adding a new lesson, TutorPro will check if the lesson clashes with any other lessons of all students. For example: 
  * Run command `new-lesson name/John Doe lesson/Math Lesson start/2023-05-21 12:00 end/2023-05-21 14:00` will add a new lesson for `John Doe` on `2023-05-21` from `12:00` to `14:00`.
  * If you then run command `new-lesson name/John Doe lesson/Science Lesson start/2023-05-21 13:00 end/2023-05-21 15:00`, which adds a new lesson for `John Doe` on `2023-05-21` from `13:00` to `15:00`, TutorPro will detect that there is a clash in the schedule and will not add the lesson for `John Doe` as a student can't have two lessons at the same time.
* We also Assume that tutors will only teach one student at a time. Therefore, if multiple students have lessons even with the same at the same time, TutorPro will detect that there is a clash in the schedule and will not add the lesson for the student. For example:
  * Run command `new-lesson name/John Doe lesson/Math Lesson start/2023-05-21 12:00 end/2023-05-21 14:00` will add a new lesson for `John Doe` on `2023-05-21` from `12:00` to `14:00`. 
  * If you then run command `new-lesson name/Irfan Ibrahim lesson/Math Lesson start/2023-05-21 12:00 end/2023-05-21 14:00`, which adds a new lesson for `Irfan Ibrahim` on `2023-05-21` from `12:00` to `14:00`, TutorPro will detect that there is a clash in the schedule and will not add the lesson for `Irfan Ibrahim` as a tutor can't teach two students at the same time.

##### With respect to existing exams
* TutorPro will detect if there is a clash between the new lesson and existing exams of the particular student.
* Since the timing of the exam is determined by the school of the student, TutorPro will prioritize the timing of the exam over the new lesson.
* We assume that a student will not have an exam and a lesson at the same time. For example:
  * Run command `new-lesson name/John Doe lesson/Math Lesson start/2023-05-21 12:00 end/2023-05-21 14:00` will add a new lesson for `John Doe` on `2023-05-21` from `12:00` to `14:00`.
  * If you then run command `new-exam name/John Doe exam/Math Exam start/2023-05-21 13:00 end/2023-05-21 15:00`, which adds a new exam for `John Doe` on `2023-05-21` from `13:00` to `15:00`, TutorPro will detect that there is a clash in the schedule and will not add the lesson for `John Doe` as a student can't have an exam and a lesson at the same time.

#### Schedule Clash Detection Mechanism when Adding a New Exam

##### With respect to existing lessons
* TutorPro will detect if there is a clash between the new exam and existing lessons of the particular student.
* Since the timing of the exam is determined by the school of the student, TutorPro will prioritize the timing of the new exam over the existing lessons.
* We assume that a student will not have an exam and a lesson at the same time. For example:
  * Run command `new-exam name/John Doe exam/Math Exam start/2023-05-21 12:00 end/2023-05-21 14:00` will add a new exam for `John Doe` on `2023-05-21` from `12:00` to `14:00`.
  * If you then run command `new-exam name/John Doe exam/Science Exam start/2023-05-21 13:00 end/2023-05-21 15:00`, which adds a new exam for `John Doe` on `2023-05-21` from `13:00` to `15:00`, unlike the previous section, TutorPro will allow you to add the exam for `John Doe` as the exam timing is more important than the lesson timing.
  * However, TutorPro will detect that there is a clash in the schedule will prompt you to update the clashed lesson's timing.

##### With respect to existing exams
* TutorPro will detect if there is a clash in the schedule of a students when adding a new exam.
* We assume that a student will not have two exams at the same time.
* Unlike adding a new lesson, when adding a new exam, TutorPro will check if the exam clashes with any other exams of the same student only. (note the difference between adding a new lesson and adding a new exam). For example:
  * Run command `new-exam name/John Doe exam/English Exam start/2023-05-21 12:00 end/2023-05-21 14:00` will add a new exam for `John Doe` on `2023-05-21` from `12:00` to `14:00`. 
  * If you run command `new-exam name/John Doe exam/Math Exam start/2023-05-21 12:00 end/2023-05-21 14:00`, which adds a new exam for `John Doe` on `2023-05-21` from `13:00` to `14:00`, TutorPro will detect that there is a clash in the schedule and will not add the exam for `John Doe` as a student can't have two exams at the same time.

### Duplicate Detection Mechanism
TutorPro will detect duplicate homeworks,
lessons and exams and will not add them to the student's list of homeworks, lessons and exams respectively.
However,
you may have noticed that duplicate homework name is not allowed but duplicate lesson name and exam name is allowed.
This is a carefully crafted feature that will be explained in the following section.

#### Duplicate Homework Detection Mechanism
* TutorPro identifies homework by its name, since we assume that a student can have multiple homeworks with the same deadline.
* Since name is the primary key for homework, duplicate homework names are not allowed. For example, if you have a homework named `Math Homework` and you try to add another homework with the same name even with a different deadline, TutorPro will detect that there is a duplicate homework and will not add the homework.
* If you homework with the same name, we encourage you to add a number to the end of the name to differentiate them. For example, `Math Homework 1` and `Math Homework 2`.

#### Duplicate Lesson Detection Mechanism
* TutorPro identifies a lesson by its start time and end time, since we assume that a student can have multiple lessons with the same name, but they can't have two lessons at the same time.
* Since start time and end time is the primary key for lessons, lessons that `clash` with other lessons aren't allowed. (See [Schedule Clash Detection Mechanism when Adding a New Lesson](#schedule-clash-detection-mechanism-when-adding-a-new-lesson) for more details)
* However, adding lessons with the duplicate name but without `clashes` with other lessons are allowed. For example:
  * if you have a lesson named `Math Lesson` for `John Doe` on `2023-05-21` from `12:00` to `14:00` 
  * you then try to add another lesson with the same name but on `2023-05-24` from `13:00` to `15:00`, TutorPro will not detect that there is a duplicate lesson and will add the lesson.

#### Duplicate Exam Detection Mechanism
* TutorPro identifies an exam by its start time and end time, since we assume that a student can have multiple exams with the same name, but they can't have two exams at the same time.
* Since start time and end time is the primary key for exams, exams that `clash` with other exams aren't allowed. (See [Schedule Clash Detection Mechanism when Adding a New Exam](#schedule-clash-detection-mechanism-when-adding-a-new-exam) for more details)
* However, adding exams with the duplicate name but without `clashes` with other exams are allowed. For example:
  * if you have an exam named `Math Exam` for `John Doe` on `2023-05-21` from `12:00` to `14:00` 
  * you then try to add another exam with the same name but on `2023-05-24` from `13:00` to `15:00`, TutorPro will not detect that there is a duplicate exam and will add the exam.

### Storage Mechanism
:biohazard: This section is for advanced users who are interested in learning about the storage mechanism of TutorPro. If you are new to TutorPro, we recommend that you skip this section and do not edit the JSON file directly.

* TutorPro stores all the data in a JSON file.
* The JSON file is located in the `data` folder of the TutorPro home folder.
* If it is your first time using TutorPro, the TutorPro home folder will be created in the same directory as the TutorPro JAR file and a sample student list will be created for your to quickly get started.
* We discourage you from editing the JSON file directly as the content you edited may not be in the correct format and may not be able to be parsed by TutorPro. 
* If the storage file is corrupted, TutorPro will create a new storage file and an empty student list.

:warning: **Warning**<br>
If what you edit in the JSON file is in the correct format but violates the constraint of TutorPro, TutorPro can parse the data file but may not be able to function as expected. For example, if you edit the end time of an exam to be earlier than the start time of the exam.
Therefore, we strongly discourage you from editing the JSON file directly unless you are absolutely sure of what you are doing.

**A**: You can view the full information of a student by running command `view-student [index/INDEX]`.
For example, if you want to view the full information of the student at index 1,
you can run command `view-student index/1`.
Alternatively, you can also view with the profile button on the student card.
