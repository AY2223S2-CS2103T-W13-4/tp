TutorPro is a **desktop app designed to help private tutors manage their student information effectively**. With TutorPro, tutors can easily keep track of their students' addresses, contact details, lessons, homework, and progress, all in one place. This app is optimized for use via a Graphical User Interface (GUI), allowing tutors to interact with the app using easy-to-understand buttons and menus. However, TutorPro also provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) for those who prefer a faster way of getting things done. Whether you're managing a handful of students or hundreds, TutorPro can help you streamline your workflow and make your tutoring experience more efficient.
