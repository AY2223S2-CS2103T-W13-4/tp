### Project: TutorPro

TutorPro is a desktop app designed to help private tutors manage their student information effectively. With TutorPro, tutors can easily keep track of their students' addresses, contact details, lessons, homework, and progress, all in one place. This app is optimised for use via a Graphical User Interface (GUI), allowing tutors to interact with the app using easy-to-understand buttons and menus. However, TutorPro also provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) for those who prefer a faster way of getting things done. Whether you're managing a handful of students or hundreds, TutorPro can help you streamline your workflow and make your tutoring experience more efficient.
