### Project: TutorPro

TutorPro is a desktop app designed to help private tutors manage their student information effectively. 
With TutorPro, tutors can easily keep track of their students' details, lesson plans, homeworks, and exams, all in one place. 
TutorPro uses a combination of GUI and CLI to provide an aesthetically-pleasing UI for viewing student's information, while promising the 
speed and control of a CLI. Whether you're managing a handful of students or hundreds, 
TutorPro can help you streamline your workflow and make your tutoring experience much more efficient.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

    -What it does: Enables users to view all lessons planned for a student by clicking on the "VIEW LESSONS" button next to their name.
    -Justification: This feature provides users with quick access to lessons planned for a student so what the tutor can know how many lessons he has taught the student, how many upcoming lessons there are, and when is the next lesson going to take place, so that he can better plan his schedule.
    -Highlights: This feature required modification to the existing codebase to add the "VIEW LESSONS" button and implement the functionality to display the lessons associated with a student.
